# Hi, my name is Joanna

I'm currently a student att Lexicon and this is an assignment from this program. I have studied some basic Javascript prior to this. This time around I wanted to get a more fundamental understanding of the code. This in order to get a better understanding and to more independently and effetively write my code. So my code might not follow best practice. 

Instead it supports my understanding of the code. As a did in my earlier Javascript I wrote and rewrote part of the code a few times. This in order to get more experience to sort of remember what to write by hand. And after pushing the project, I feel that I want to conquer Javascript.

# Challenges
My biggest challenges in this project though, was to to choose an API that I pair with my understanding of the code. And choosing the API took me much longer than writing the code. 

# Mindset change
One thing that usually works for me, is to take a break. So eventually, I decided to attack this project from another angle. So I watched a few Youtube videos that recommended different APIs. Since I'm interested it projects that helps or entertains the user in different ways. So I decided to test 2 APIs and then choose the one that would take the least amount of time . One was https://api.adviceslip.com and one was a suduko API. I choose to create an Advice generator.

# Functionality
I have used local storage and CRUD functionality. I used a fetch function to get the API. The page displays a card, in which you either can choose to get a new advice or to save an advice to a dynamic list.

# UI 
In the end, I choose to use UI that I had used in a previous project. 

# If I had more time...
...i would make the project responsive and work on the accessibility
...create a routine, where I systematically search to find errors

# I learned a lot when it comes to 
- DOM manipulation
- Local storage
- But most of all... wait for it...

...I have learned to appreciate result that I can see in the DOM. But watching different people coding on Youtube, I realized that instead of viewing the result in the DOM, they view the result in the console. 
And instead of striving for the end result, they create one element or function at the time. This will definately reduce the frustration in me and the amount of different javascript files I will create.

# So if I would create this project from scatch, I would:
- Choose a quite simple API and ask for help if I get stuck choosing
- Create a MVP
- Work one element or function at the time (read: more patience)
- Use console.log meticulously
- Create an approximate timeframe for different part of the project
